Note: In this project, I used the components prepared by tailwindblock. It is a very carefully and beautifully prepared package, 
you can check it out here 👉🏻 https://github.com/mertJF/tailblocks

You can shorten your front-end development time considerably by using tailwindcss with ready-made components on this site.
- Select and drag the component you want
- Arrange the components the way you want
- Get the source code when you're done
- Little not: I'm aware of some bugs and UX improvements. Currently I'm working on them!
